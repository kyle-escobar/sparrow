# Sparrow
Dynamic update framework for OSRS that generates mappings between
different revision obfuscations.

Sparrow is designed to be future proof and not rely on static bytecode analysis but
rather uses dynamic bytecode feature identification to classify Classes, 
Methods, and Fields.

## Notice
This project is currently a WIP and is not finished. This readme will be updated
in the future.
